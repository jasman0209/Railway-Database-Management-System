When we work on a Relational Database , DBMS has some commands that helps a user to interact with the database.Let me add some of those commands.

1.) DDL commands (Data Definition Language) :- These commands are used to create tables, make some changes (update) tables , delete tables etc.The commands of DDL include:-
A. Create     B.) Alter    C.) Truncate    D.) Rename      E.) Drop

2.) DML Commands (Data Manipulation Language) :- These commands are used to make some changes in the data of the tables and run some query on tables and get the desired output.
The DML Commands include :- A.) Select   B.) Insert   C.) Update   D.) Delete

3.) DCL Commands(Data Control Language) :- These commands are used to give access of database or take the authorization of database from a current user.These commands include:-
A.) Grant     B.) Revoke

4.) TCL Commands (Transaction Control Language) :- These commands are used to save changes and set transactions when process is in mid-way.These commands include:-
A.) Commit   B.) Rollback   C.) Savepoint   D.) Set Transaction

Difference between Delete , Drop and Truncate :-

1.) Delete is a DML commands whereas Truncate and Drop are DDL commands.

2.) Delete is used to drop row data one by one while Truncate deletes all the rows together and Drop deletes the whole table.
